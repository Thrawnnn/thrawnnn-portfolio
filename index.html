        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I started development at the start of 2023 in Java and JavaFX. I then moved on to code for my Garry's Mod Server and found it to be quite fun to program Graphics. Once I found my Niche I started taking small jobs eventually landing a job at Project: Warfront where I am today.</p>

          <!-- JAVA FX Flappy bird -->
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Java FX Flappy Bird</h3>
                <p>Yep, you heard it right. During my First year in Computer Science I made a remake of a game in Java FX. This game was flappy bird and has been collecting dust for some time now in my Github</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Complexity networks -->
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Complexity Networks Half-Life 2 Roleplay</h3>
                <p>This was a Garry's mod server I ran in the beginning of 2023. This helped me the most in my Garry's Mod career and has taught me a lot about server-client relationships and Graphical Design.</p>

            <!-- Project Warfront -->
            <div class="project">
              <h3>Project: Warfront - UI/UX Developer</h3>
              <p>I am currently a UI/UX Developer for Project: Warfront. I work as their sole specialist in the field.</p>

          <!-- BOLT -->
          <div class="project">
            <h3>BOLT: Framework</h3>
            <p>BOLT was my first GMod Gamemode which is unfortunately still WIP and therefore Closed Source except to testers. The goal of BOLT was to be a visually appealing Gmod CVR Gamemode boilerplate for anyone interested in CvR. It is modular and very editable since it is an extension of GMod's sandbox gamemode.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="project">
            <h3>GMedals</h3>
            <p>GMedals was a big stepping stone in my Gmod development career. It was a culmination of multiple different key points that I had learned so far and included optimizing code, modular designs, and sleek and feature filled UI Design. This is available publically and is open source.</p>
